## Claude SKILL

Since `triage` is a separate library, LLMs might not have a lot of experience working with it. The following is a Claude `SKILL.md` file (under development still) that people can use to improve Claude's ability to work with `triage`. It may also help train other LLMs to use `triage`.

See the latest [SKILL.md file in the repo](https://github.com/cheerfulstoic/triage/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) if you'd like to add it to your own environment.
